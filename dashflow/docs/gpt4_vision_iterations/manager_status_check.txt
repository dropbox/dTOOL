MANAGER STATUS CHECK:

Context: 61% (611k/1M) - Above 60% warning
Iteration: 2 complete, still 7/10
Progress: Some improvements, but overall score unchanged

User wants: Keep iterating to 9+/10
Remaining work: 2-3 more iterations
Context needed: ~30-40% more

DECISION:
- User said 'continue' explicitly
- At warning threshold but not limit (70%)
- Can do 1 more iteration (to ~70% context)
- Then MUST stop

Next: Implement strong statistical rigor improvements
Target: 8-8.5/10 on iteration 3
