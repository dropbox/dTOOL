## Category Notes

This category covers AppleScript, Python API, and scripting-related issues.

### Common Patterns

1. **Python Runtime Issues** - Many issues relate to Python runtime installation, version compatibility, and ARM64 vs x86_64 architecture
2. **Python API Deprecation** - Several issues ask about Python 3.7 requirements vs newer system Python
3. **API Not Working** - Issues with scripts deactivating on upgrade or runtime failing to start
4. **AppleScript Slowness** - Reports of AppleScript becoming sluggish or not responding
5. **Session/Window API** - Issues with getting/setting session properties via scripting
6. **Autolaunch Problems** - Scripts not running at startup or on new session
