## Category Notes

P3 Profile and Settings triage **COMPLETE**. All 142 issues categorized. This category covers profile management, automatic profile switching, preferences, dynamic profiles, and settings sync.

### Common Patterns

1. **Automatic Profile Switching** - Profiles not switching based on hostname/path rules, wildcard issues
2. **Preference Sync** - iCloud sync not working, preferences lost between machines
3. **Dynamic Profiles** - Issues with JSON dynamic profiles not loading or having invalid data
4. **Profile Corruption** - "This session's profile no longer exists" errors, profiles reverting to defaults
5. **Locale/Language Settings** - LC_CTYPE issues, encoding problems across different systems
6. **Preferences UI** - UI glitches in preferences window, settings not sticking
7. **Working Directory** - "Reuse previous session's directory" not working as expected
