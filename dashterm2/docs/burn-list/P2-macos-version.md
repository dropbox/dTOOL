## Category Notes

macOS version-specific issues are often transient - they get fixed in subsequent macOS or iTerm2 releases. Issues for macOS versions before Ventura (13.x) are marked as Skip (Old) since we target modern macOS.

### Common Patterns

1. **Permissions issues** - Full Disk Access, sandbox restrictions, Gatekeeper
2. **UI compatibility** - Appearance changes in new macOS versions
3. **Beta/nightly issues** - Problems with pre-release software
4. **Mission Control/Dock** - macOS system UI interactions
5. **Session restoration** - Permissions needed after restart
