## Category Notes

P2 Copy/Paste/Selection triage **COMPLETE**. All 87 issues categorized.

### Common Patterns

1. **Selection issues**: Many involve double-click word selection, triple-click line selection, and rectangular selection in copy mode
2. **Paste issues**: Bracketed paste (00~/01~ prefix), large paste truncation, Unicode character handling
3. **Middle-click paste**: Multiple reports of middle-click not working, often macOS version specific
4. **Trailing spaces**: Both selection and copy operations have issues with trailing whitespace handling
5. **Vague/old issues**: Many 2016-2019 issues lack repro steps or are obsolete due to architecture changes
