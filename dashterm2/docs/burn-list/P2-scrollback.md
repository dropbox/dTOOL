## Category Notes

Scrollback issues often relate to memory management, rendering synchronization, and mouse/trackpad event handling. Many older issues (pre-2019) were related to the legacy renderer which has been replaced by Metal.

### Common Patterns

1. **Unlimited scrollback memory** - RAM grows unbounded (#7847)
2. **Scrollbar appearance** - Wrong color, visibility issues
3. **Mouse wheel handling** - Specific mouse models, scroll speed
4. **Resize behavior** - Scrollback corrupted on resize
5. **Scroll inertia** - Focus issues with split panes
6. **Search in scrollback** - Missing results, slow performance
